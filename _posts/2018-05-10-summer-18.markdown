I will be using this blog as a medium to document all that I learn this summer. I intend to implement 2-3 projects to showcase the stuff that I have learned over the course of the Summer. I plan to write atleast one blog article per week describing my progress but I might write more if I have some good content. I am sure you guys will learn a lot along with me in the days to come.

Below is a list of topics that I plan to devote my time to this summer.

### Code Related:
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Web Development
* Contributing to Open Source

### Miscellaneous:
* Cooking.
* Playing the ukulele.
