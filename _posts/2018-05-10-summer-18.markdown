I will be using this blog as a medium to document all that I learn this summer. I intend to apply my learnings to practical projects. I plan to write atleast one blog article per week describing my progress but I might write more if I have some good content. I am sure you guys will learn a lot along with me in the days to come.

Below is a list of topics that I plan to devote my time to this summer.

### Code Related:
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Web Development
* Contributing to Open Source

### Miscellaneous:
* Cooking.
* Playing the ukulele.

This list is going to be dynamic and I am going to modify it as the summer progresses.<br>
Further I am going to take up the [#100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge and track my progress on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rsarky/100-days-of-code)

Here's to a summer full of learning.
