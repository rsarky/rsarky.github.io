Hey there, I am Rohit Sarkar.

I try to make computers do useful things.
Okay, mostly useful things.
Some of the things that I have done are on [github](www.github.com/rsarky)

I am always learning about something or the other that I find interesting.
Recently I have been looking into probabilistic programming and bayesian
statistics.

I utilise some of my down time for reading. Currently I am reading Deep Work by
Cal Newport.
