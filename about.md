Hi, I am Rohit Sarkar. I am an undergrad studying Computer Science in [Manipal Institute
of Technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html), Manipal. Whenever I am not coding I must be outside playing cricket,football,basketball or any other outdoor activity that I might have taken up. As you might have gathered I love sports and I am especially good at cricket. Other than sports I am an avid reader and like to travel.

I aim to bring about positive changes in the world using code.
